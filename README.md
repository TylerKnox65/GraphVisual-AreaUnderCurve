# GraphVisual-AreaUnderCurve
Features:

Dynamic Plotting: You just have to input the corresponding number for the type of graph they require. For example, if they input 1, they will get the 2D graph; if one inputs 2, they will get the 3D graph. Interactively change the view of the 3D plot in terms of the viewing angle using a slider.

Area under the Curve Calculation: The code does this for both 2D and 3D plots by various numerical integration methods. For 3D plot, the script interpolates the function values so that the shaded surface under the function is the actual area under the function (Maybe).


Usage:

Run the script and specify if the plot should be 2D or 3D.
Set bounds
Enter mathematical expression (in terms of x for 2D, or in terms of x and y for 3D).
